make me an example of a basic Makefile for a golang project

Here's a basic example of a Makefile for a Golang project:

makefile
Copy code
# Define the Go executable
GO = go

# Define the binary name
BINARY = myapp

# Define the build flags
BUILD_FLAGS = -ldflags "-s -w"

# Define the test flags
TEST_FLAGS = -v -cover

# Build the binary
build:
	$(GO) build $(BUILD_FLAGS) -o $(BINARY) .

# Run the binary
run:
	./$(BINARY)

# Test the package
test:
	$(GO) test $(TEST_FLAGS) .

# Clean the binary
clean:
	rm -f $(BINARY)

# Format the code
fmt:
	$(GO) fmt .

# Vet the code
vet:
	$(GO) vet .
You can save this to a file named Makefile in your project's root directory. Then, you can use the following commands:

make build to build the binary
make run to run the binary
make test to run the tests
make clean to remove the binary
make fmt to format the code
make vet to vet the code
This is a basic example, and you can customize it according to your project's needs.





if I want a multiline commands to be executed in a makefile command?
To execute multiline commands in a Makefile, you can use one of the following methods:

1. Use a backslash () at the end of each line
makefile
Copy code
mytarget:
	echo "This is line 1"; \
	echo "This is line 2"; \
	echo "This is line 3"
Each line ends with a backslash, and the commands are executed as a single block.

2. Use a single-line command with semicolons
makefile
Copy code
mytarget:
	echo "This is line 1"; echo "This is line 2"; echo "This is line 3"
This method is less readable but can be useful for short commands.

3. Define a multiline variable
makefile
Copy code
define MY_COMMAND
	echo "This is line 1"
	echo "This is line 2"
	echo "This is line 3"
endef

mytarget:
	$(MY_COMMAND)
This method is useful when you need to reuse a block of code.

4. Use a shell function
makefile
Copy code
mytarget:
	@bash -c ' \
		echo "This is line 1"; \
		echo "This is line 2"; \
		echo "This is line 3" \
	'
This method is useful when you need to execute a complex block of shell code.

Note that the @ symbol before the command suppresses the echoing of the command itself.
